# Launchpads

This page documents the launchpads exposed in LaunchDeck and separates the supported paths from the experimental ones.

## Support Summary

### Supported

- `pump`
- `bonk`

### Experimental

- `bagsapp`

If you want the most predictable path, start with Pump or Bonk before trying Bagsapp.

## Pump

Status: `supported`

Pump is the most native launch path in LaunchDeck today.

Supported modes:

- `regular`
- `cashback`
- `agent-custom`
- `agent-unlocked`
- `agent-locked`

Current Pump characteristics:

- launch assembly is native Rust
- transaction shaping is native Rust
- versioned transaction choice is measured rather than hard-coded
- default lookup tables are warmed and persisted locally
- immediate dev-buy support can include the account extension and ATA setup needed before the buy path

### Pump Mode Guide

#### `regular`

Use this for the standard Pump launch path.

- normal Pump creation flow
- creator fee stays on the deployer by default
- can include an immediate dev buy
- can optionally generate later fee-sharing setup

#### `cashback`

Use this for the Pump cashback creation variant.

- same core creation flow as `regular`
- cashback behavior is marked in the Pump creation payload
- later fee-sharing setup can still be used when configured

#### `agent-unlocked`

Use this when you want an agent launch without a later agent setup transaction.

- agent is initialized during creation
- creator rewards are not rerouted into the locked escrow model
- no follow-up `agent-setup` transaction is emitted
- `buybackBps` is required

#### `agent-custom`

Use this when you want a custom post-launch recipient setup.

- agent is initialized during creation
- final custom recipient setup is deferred to `agent-setup`
- the follow-up applies the configured recipient split
- `buybackBps` is required

#### `agent-locked`

Use this when you want the locked agent escrow path.

- agent is initialized during creation
- creator rewards route through the locked escrow model
- a follow-up `agent-setup` transaction is emitted
- `buybackBps` is required

### Pump Restrictions And Rules

- `feeSharing.generateLaterSetup` is supported only in `regular`
- later fee-sharing setup requires fee recipients
- fee-sharing recipients must total `10000` bps
- agent modes require `buybackBps`

## Bonk

Status: `supported`

Supported Bonk coverage:

- `regular`
- `bonkers`
- quote asset `sol`
- quote asset `usd1`
- immediate dev buy
- same-time sniper buys
- snipe buys
- snipe sells
- automatic dev sell

Current Bonk characteristics:

- validation, transport planning, reporting, simulation, and send orchestration are Rust-owned
- launch assembly uses the Raydium LaunchLab-backed helper bridge
- `regular` routes through LetsBonk
- `bonkers` routes through the Bonkers path on Raydium LaunchLab
- `usd1` uses a pinned Raydium `SOL -> USD1` route pool for top-up behavior when the wallet needs USD1 before buying
- `usd1` same-time sniper buys are assembled as atomic swap-and-buy transactions
- same-time buys use launch-first safeguards so the buy path does not outrun the creation path
- immediate dev buy on `usd1` attempts atomic launch-plus-buy assembly and can fall back to split transactions if the combined message is too large

### Bonk Restrictions

- only `regular` and `bonkers` are supported
- Pump-only modes such as `cashback`, `agent-custom`, `agent-unlocked`, and `agent-locked` are rejected
- fee-sharing setup is rejected
- `mayhem` is rejected
- per-sniper `postBuySell` chaining is not supported yet

## Bagsapp

Status: `experimental`

Bagsapp is available when Bags credentials are configured, but it is still experimental in this repo.

Current Bags behavior includes:

- `bags-2-2`
- `bags-025-1`
- `bags-1-025`
- quote asset `sol`
- wallet-only identity
- linked identity when the selected LaunchDeck wallet belongs to the authenticated Bags account
- immediate dev buy
- same-time sniper buys
- snipe buys
- snipe sells
- automatic dev sell
- LaunchDeck fee-split UI mapped into Bags fee-claimer rows

Current Bags characteristics:

- launch assembly uses the hosted Bags API or SDK bridge
- linked identity is validated against the selected LaunchDeck wallet
- same-time buy compilation is deferred until after launch submission so the trade route can resolve against the live mint
- history persists the identity mode and display name, but not sensitive auth material

### Bags Restrictions

- `sol` is the only current quote asset
- Pump-only modes are rejected
- `mayhem` is rejected
- creator fee must remain the deployer wallet

## Launchpad Choice Guidance

Choose `pump` if you want the most native LaunchDeck path.

Choose `bonk` if you want the supported Bonk and Bonkers path, including `usd1` and follow automation.

Choose `bagsapp` only if you are comfortable using an experimental path.
